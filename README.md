# Machine Learning Models to Predict Sales and High-Growth-Rate Companies
This project is a part of the curriculum of UE Machine Learning (Supervised Learning) under Master 2 - Data Science de la Faculté des Sciences Economiques et de Gestion, Université de Strasbourg. 

# Context 

Objective: Detecting high-growth firms

The dataset in this assigment comes from a random extraction of the Survey on Business Strategies (Encuesta Sobre Estrategias Empresariales – ESEE). This annual survey gathers extensive information on around 2,000 manufacturing companies operating in Spain and employing at least ten workers. The dataset at your disposal covers the period 2000–2012.

With this type of information, a data analyst can finally start looking for (potentially interesting) correlations and patterns regarding what determines high-growth firms (HGF). 

HGF can be defined in two different ways: 
- (i) based on their sales growth rate [continuous variable];
- (ii) companies with extreme growth performance, i.e. belonging to the top 10% of the annual sales growth distribution [binary variable].

Our task is predict which company is going to be a HGF in the last of year of the sample [your test set]. This is very important for managers and policy-maker, for example if they wish to identify promising companies for M&A and/or target financial support.
